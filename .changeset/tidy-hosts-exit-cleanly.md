Keep the CLI's own output uncorrupted, and make it exit.

Two bugs that only show up once the CLI hosts a non-trivial application.

**`core`: the development audit sink no longer writes to stdout.** `consoleAuditSink()` used `console.debug`, which is the verbose channel in a browser but an alias of `console.log` in Node — so it wrote to stdout, the stream the CLI renders into. Any app deriving its environment the ordinary Vite way (`import.meta.env.PROD ? "production" : "development"`, and `PROD` is `false` under vite-node) got a registration trace interleaved with the command's output, which made `agent-surface inspect --json` emit unparseable JSON and buried `check`'s drift report in CI. Under Node the sink now writes to stderr; in browsers it stays on `console.debug`. The trail moved streams, it was not silenced (`AS-OBSV-002`, `AS-CLI-004`).

**`cli`: a command now ends when it is done.** The binary only set `process.exitCode`, so anything the mounted app left running — a polling interval, a websocket, a data layer whose cache timer outlives the render — kept the process alive after the output was complete and correct. It presented as a hang with a successful exit code already set, and nothing on screen to explain it. A finished command is now given a moment to exit on its own; if it does not, the CLI names the handles still holding the loop and exits anyway. A tidy app never sees the message (`AS-CLI-005`).

Also: `installDom()` returns `void` instead of a disposer that did nothing. The DOM is process-wide and permanent on purpose — `react-dom` captures `window` at import — and the signature now says so rather than reading like teardown at the call site. It is internal to the binary, not a package export, so nothing downstream sees the change.

`react`, `orpc`, `testing` and `webmcp` carry no code change in this release; they are versioned along with the rest to keep the six packages on one line.
