Require consumer authorization for external capability contracts (contract format v5).

A dependency could previously contribute capabilities to the manifest just by being in the production graph — through an `agentSurface.contract` sidecar, or by calling a contract macro in its own shipped source, which needed no sidecar and produced no digest at all. Discovery is no longer authorization: both routes now require an explicit approval keyed by package name.

```ts
agentSurface({
  externalContracts: {
    allow: [{ package: "@vendor/plugin", digest: "6f4b…" }],
  },
})
```

The manifest records contract integrity (`contractDigest`) and consumer consent (`authorization.expectedDigest`) as separate fields, so an unapproved contributor and an approved contributor that changed are distinguishable failures. Both fail the build with the digest to review; neither has an escape flag.

**Breaking.** `formatVersion` is now `5` — run `agent-surface snapshot` to regenerate committed contracts. The plugin's `externalContracts` option takes `{ allow: [...] }` instead of an array of `{ path, digest }`; `PinnedContractInput` is replaced by `ExternalContractAllowEntry` and `ExternalContractPolicy`, and `ExternalCapabilityContractDigest` by `ExternalContractAttribution`. The CLI approves a dependency with `--allow <package>=<sha256>`.
